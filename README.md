    <h2>DIET TIPS AND PLANS</h2>
    <h3 class="colored-section">Never be hungry</h3>
<p class="colored-section">
  Eating small meals every 2-3 hours stokes your metabolism. Forgoing food for long periods plunges your body into panic mode, making it store food as fat.<br> Flood your system with a steady supply of nutrients to help you burn fat and build muscle all day long.</p>

  <h3 class="colored-section">Have protein with every meal</h3>
  <p class="colored-section">Protein is vital for muscle building which is important in its own right and helps to burn fat – every additional pound of muscle burns 50 calories a day.<br> Eat at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight every day.<br> For the best results vary your sources by eating fish, beef, poultry, legumes, nuts, eggs and dairy</p>
<h3 class="colored-section">Never be Thirsty</h3>
<p class="colored-section">Water shuttles nutrients to every part of your body including your muscles.<br> Dehydration prevents you from exercising at your peak aerobically and anaerobically, making you less effective at building muscle and burning fat.<br> Drink 2-3 litres a day – more if you’re training hard.</p>
<h3 class="colored-section">Embrace carbs at the right time</h3>
<p class="colored-section" >Shun carbs at your peril. They provide energy to fuel exercise and refuel afterwards. Eat the majority of your carbs before lunch to stay lean then munch slow digesting carbs, such as whole-wheat bread, 40-60 minutes before training and fast digesting carbs, such as a potato, directly after exercise to refuel.
</p>

<h3 class="colored-section">Drink tea</h3>
<p class="colored-section">reen tea is a well-established fat-burner but if you’re a traditionalist then black tea is also effective. <br>Research in the journal Psychopharmacology found that 4 cups of black tea lowered cortisol levels by 50%.<br> This hormone is responsible for cannibalising muscle and weight gain. Sip as much sugar-free tea as you can manage.
</p>
<h3 class="colored-section">Don’t avoid fats</h3>
<p class="colored-section">Choose your fats wisely and substitute trans and saturated fats – such as those found in animal and take-away products,<br> for unsaturated fats found in vegetable products. The latter will fuel weight loss, while the former will sabotage them.
</p>
<h3 class="colored-section">Eat before and after every workout</h3>
<p class="colored-section">
  If you’re exercising, then the most important meal of the day is not breakfast – it’s the meals before and after exercise.<br> Always have a protein and carb-filled meal at these times or you’ll take one step forward and two steps back.<br> For the best results bracket your workouts with a whey protein shake to get the quickest delivery of vital nutrients to your muscles.
</p>
<h3 class="colored-section">Eat plenty of fibre</h3>
<p class="colored-section">Fibre helps you feel fuller for longer and supplies your muscles with a lasting release of energy and nutrients. The best weight loss and muscle-building plan is to substitute carbs for fibre.<br> Good sources include veggies, fruits, brown rice and lentils.
</p>
<h3 class="colored-section">Have a cheat day</h3>
<p class="colored-section">Schedule a day each week to eat your favourite foods and you won’t feel like you’re constantly depriving yourself.<br> This is a strategy that competitive body-builders use and will make you more likely to stick with a healthy eating plain in the long term.</p>

<h3 class="colored-section">Eat before going to bed</h3>
<p class="colored-section">
  This dietary no-no has gotten a reprieve.<br> When you sleep your body steals amino acids from your muscles (your fat burners) to fuel your brain in the absence of food. Eat slow digesting proteins like peanut butter,<br> cottage cheese or a casein-based protein powder to keep your body flush with nutrients and stoke your metabolism.
